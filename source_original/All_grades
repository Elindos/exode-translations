In EXODE skills are called "Grades".

Academical Grades have results known by the commander.
This is the case of many things tested for anyone on a spaceship, such as piloting, ability to use hardpoint-attached weapons, etc.


Non-academical grades, which are personal scores of the crew, are often not "exposed".
They may become discovered if they are far above, or far below the average.

In this case, we make appear "some traits".
This can  inform the commander of "bad traits" (if they are far below average) or "good traits" (if they are far above average)

In the list below, some traits are already displayed by the program.
